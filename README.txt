We implemented MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and limited depth of 4 against greedy algorithm provided by professor.
File minmax_player.py contains the implementation.
Execution:
Run following commands in different terminals.
Step 1: python reversi_server.py
Step 2: python greedy_player.py
Step 3: python minmax_player.py
Swap step 2 and 3 to change color of players (who goes first)
